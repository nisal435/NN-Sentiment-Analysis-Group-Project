* Project Name: TasteMood Analyzer: Sentiment Analysis and Trend Dashboard Using Hugging Face Pretrained Model

* Overview:

TasteMood Analyzer is a web-based sentiment analysis platform that evaluates users' food experiences.
It uses a Hugging Face pretrained RoBERTa model (cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment) to classify text input into Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiments.
The frontend (Streamlit) interacts with a backend (FastAPI) for real-time predictions and visualizations, while also storing analysis results into a local SQLite database for trend tracking.
